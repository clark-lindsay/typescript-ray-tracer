# typescript-ray-tracer

## Purpose

This project is made entirely for practice, and would not be a good substitute for something like three.js.

Its purpose is a reasonably large playground for me to play with typescript and practice design principles and good
coding practices, while also producing some fairly neat images to keep me motivated :)
